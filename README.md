# Foodborne Disease Outbreaks Dashboard

<div align="justify"><font size="2"><b>This dashboard is part of the Project Summary Report on Foodborne Disease Outbreaks, which can be acessed on: <a href="https://github.com/bdetanico">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/bdetanico">Kaggle</a></b>.

A foodborne disease outbreak (FBO) is defined as two or more cases of similar illnesses caused by the same agent (e.g., a toxin, virus or bacteria) which are linked to the same food source. The CDC estimates that each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.

The collection of data on foodborne outbreaks is imperative to identify the pathogen and the food vehicle involved, providing relevant information to monitor the prevalence of foodborne disease. In addition, such data contribute to evaluate trends and can provide the basis for regulatory changes and public health actions to improve food safety and reduce illness and death caused by foodborne diseases.</font></div>
